# Landing-Page

This is an exercise from "The Odin Project" where i practice
all the theory i learned about Flexbox. The point of this assignment is to create something from scratch and get the various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest. I was given a photo of a page and i used Flexbox to recreate it my own.it was fun!
